In this example, the user is stored with first token given, and
it isn't updated even when given a new token.

Seems like the access token lasts for a long time, so new tokens can be ignored.

I have to logout of facebook in same browser window (different tab) in order to 
be prompted by facebook again for full credentials. Otherwise clicking on 
Facebook login link seems to skip the full credentials prompt.
